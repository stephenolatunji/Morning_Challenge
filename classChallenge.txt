Improvement of HTML5 Over Predecessors

HTML5 contains built-in support for integrated Audios and Videos.  Earlier versions of HTML have multimedia contents integrated in web pages with third party plugins.

HTML5 contains Javascript Web Worker API which enables Javascipt to run in Web browser which was not possible in previous HTML.

HTML5 enables the use of Web SQL database and application cache. In previous versions, browser cache is used as temporary storage.

HTML5 has JS Geolocation which can be used to identify the location of a user accessing the website.

It is supported by all new browsers

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head
    <title>Video</title>
</head>
 
<body>
<video src=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCZI9S_Wo9w" width="640px" height="360" controls> ></video>
 
</body>
</html>


Result of Not Specifying Doctype in HTML

Not specifying the Doctype in an HTML document will result in ill-rendering of the page in browsers. The browser will enter a Quirk Mode (Compatibility mode) and renders the page as old document type.
